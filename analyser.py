Each match json contains the following fields we care about:

match_id - unique id for the match
match_creation = not really needed since we have the match timestamp, should be identical
participants = game info about all 10 match_participants
timeline = big timeline of events within the match
participantIdentities = maps participantId to the summoner data, includes IMPORTANT matchHistoryURL

Timeline is broken into frames, each of which encompasses a minute of the game.

Each frame contains:    timestamp (beginning of frame), 
                        participantFrames (dict) snapshot of all 10 players
                        events (dict) list of events occurring within the frame 


Event Handling types:
each EVENT has an optional: assistingParticipantIds field for other participants (list type)

Skill:  SKILL_LEVEL_UP:  level up skill event, by participant + skillslot
            LEVEL_UP_TYPE: EVOLVE for viktor/khazix/??syndra??, NORMAL for everything else

Item:   ITEM_PURCHASE - buy
        ITEM_SOLD - sell
        ITEM_UNDO - undo buy or sell (item_before indicates what item was, item_after...)
        ITEM_DESTROYED - item used (potions)

Ward:   WARD_PLACED - timestamp, type, creatorID
        WARD_KILL - killerID, timetamp, type

Champ kill:   
        assistingParticipantIds (list)
        killerId
        position (x,y on the map)
