Each match json contains the following fields we care about:

match_id - unique id for the match
match_creation = not really needed since we have the match timestamp, should be identical
participants = game info about all 10 match_participants
timeline = big timeline of events within the match
participantIdentities = maps participantId to the summoner data, includes IMPORTANT matchHistoryURL
